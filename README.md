# Windows DoH Registry - More DNS Privacy Options

**Expand Windows DNS over HTTPS (DoH) support from 3 providers to 12 providers with one registry import.**


---

DNS0.eu has been discontinued on October 17th, 2025. 
For secure DNS-over-HTTPS, use alternatives like DNS4EU or NextDNS.io.

### Step 1: Download & Import the Registry File
1. **[Click here to download: Doh-Well-Known-Servers.reg](Doh-Well-Known-Servers.reg)** (Right-click → "Save link as")
2. **Right-click** the downloaded file → Select **"Merge"**
3. Click **"Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
4. Done! All 125 DoH configurations from 12 providers are now available in Windows

### Step 2: Choose Your DNS Provider

**Windows 11:** Settings → Network & Internet → Properties → DNS server assignment → Edit  
**Windows 10:** Settings → Network → Change adapter options → Right-click connection → Properties → IPv4

**Popular DNS IPs:**
- Cloudflare Security (Fast, privacy-focused).
- Quad9 (Blocks malware).
- Mullvad (Excellent privacy and strong blocking)
- DNS4EU(EU-based, zero-logging).
- Control D (Excellent privacy, zero-logging, excellence in optional).

### 🧩 How “Autotemplate” Works
When you add DNS providers to DohWellKnownServers, Windows will automatically suggest the correct DoH template when you enter a matching DNS IP in your network settings. This “autotemplate” feature makes it easy for anyone to set up encrypted DNS—just enter the IP, and Windows fills in the rest!

</a>




When you enter a supported DNS IP, Windows fills in the DoH template automatically!

### ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**Q: I get an error when importing the .reg file.**

A: Make sure you have administrator rights. Right-click the .reg file and select "Run as administrator." If you see a syntax error, check that the file was downloaded completely and is not corrupted.

**Q: I don’t see the DoH template appear when I enter a DNS IP.**

A: Make sure you’ve imported the latest Doh-Well-Known-Servers.reg file and are using a supported DNS IP. Restart your computer or network adapter if changes don’t appear immediately.

**Q: How do I validate the registry entries?**

A: Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Get-DnsClientDohServerAddress
```

You should see DNS IPs with DoH template URLs. If you see "False" values, **that's normal** – it means DoH is working correctly!

**Q: How do I remove these entries?**

A: Use Registry Editor to navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\Parameters\DohWellKnownServers` and delete the relevant keys. Always back up your registry before making changes.

**Q: Is this safe?**

A: Yes! The registry file only adds trusted DoH templates and does not change your current DNS settings. Always download .reg files from trusted sources.

**Safety Tips:**

- Always back up your registry before making changes.
- Only import .reg files you trust.
- If you encounter issues, restore your registry from a backup.

**Q: My system is unstable or registry errors persist after troubleshooting. What’s the best fix?**


A: If troubleshooting takes too long or registry issues persist, you can easily repair Windows with an upgrade installation:

**Quick Fix: Repair Windows with an ISO (No Data Loss)**

1. **Download the latest Windows ISO:** [Download Windows 10/11 ISO from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows)
2. **Right-click the ISO file** in File Explorer and select **"Mount"**. This will create a new virtual DVD drive.
3. **Open the new drive** and double-click **`setup.exe`**.
4. Follow the prompts and choose **"Keep personal files and apps"** when asked. This will repair Windows while keeping your files and programs.
5. Let the upgrade complete and restart your PC.

This process repairs system files and registry issues without deleting your data or installed software. Only choose a clean install if you want to start completely fresh. For most users, the upgrade installation is a safe and easy fix for persistent problems.

### ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Will this change my current DNS provider?**
A: No. The registry file only adds new DoH templates. You still choose your DNS provider in Windows Settings.

**Q: Can I safely remove these registry entries?**
A: Yes. You can use Registry Editor to delete the relevant keys, or restore a backup.

**Q: Is it safe to import these registry files?**
A: Yes, as long as you download them from trusted sources. Always back up your registry before making changes.

**Q: What if I see errors when importing?**
A: Make sure you have administrator rights and the file is not corrupted. See Troubleshooting for more help.

**Q: How do I verify the DoH templates are working?**
A: Use PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-DnsClientDohServerAddress
```

**Q: Can I contribute or suggest new providers?**
A: Yes! Open an issue or pull request on GitHub, or contact the project maintainer.

### 🌐 Global InterfaceSpecificParameters: Systemwide DoH Enforcement

For advanced users, IT administrators, and managed workstations: you can enforce DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) systemwide across all network adapters (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VPN, etc.) using Global InterfaceSpecificParameters. This method is not dependent on network GUIDs and applies DoH settings globally, guaranteeing encrypted DNS for every interface.

- **Not GUID-dependent:** Applies to all adapters, not just one specific network.
- **Ideal for:** IT admins, managed devices, or users who want guaranteed DoH enforcement everywhere.
- **How it works:** Adds a 'GlobalDohIP' section to the registry, matching all major DNS providers in the DoH autotemplate.

#### 📥 Download the Global InterfaceSpecificParameters Registry File

- [Click here to download: Global-InterfaceSpecificParameter.reg](Global-Interface-Specific-Parameters/Global-InterfaceSpecificParameter.reg) (Right-click → "Save link as")
- Right-click the downloaded file → Select "Merge"
- Click "Yes" when Windows asks for permission
- Done! DoH is now enforced systemwide for all supported DNS providers

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Is This Safe?**

**Yes!** This registry file:
- ✅ Only adds DoH templates (doesn't change your current DNS)
- ✅ Doesn't modify any system files
- ✅ Is fully reversible
- ✅ Contains no personal information
- ✅ Has been verified against official provider documentation

**What it does:** Tells Windows "If you see IP X.X.X.X, use DoH template Y"  
**What it doesn't do:** Change your DNS settings automatically

You still control which DNS provider you use through Windows Settings.

**All 125 configurations verified against official sources.** ✅

## 🎯 What This Does

Microsoft's Windows has supported DNS over HTTPS since 2020, but only includes **3 DNS providers** by default:
- Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
- Google (8.8.8.8)
- Quad9 (9.9.9.9)

This registry adds **9 more privacy-focused DNS providers** with 125 total configurations, giving you more choices for encrypted DNS.

## ❓ Why Did I Create This?

I'm a Greenlander IT enthusiast who successfully advocated for **File Explorer tabs in Windows**. Microsoft listened to community feedback and delivered!

Now I'm back with another community improvement: **expanding Windows' DoH provider list** beyond the same 3 providers it's had since 2020.

This project represents **years of research and verification**. I'm sharing it openly because:
- Users need more DNS privacy options NOW
- Microsoft's list hasn't been updated in 5+ years
- Community contributions should be shared
- Maybe Microsoft will expand their default list (again!) 🇬🇱➡️🪟
