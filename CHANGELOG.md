# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-14 - Initial Public Release üéâ

### Project Background
This registry configuration was built over several years by a Greenlander IT enthusiast (IT-Supporter turned IT-Technologist student) who successfully advocated for File Explorer tabs in Windows 11. After that collaboration success with Microsoft, this project tackles another Windows improvement: expanding the DoH provider list that hasn't been updated since 2020.

Starting from interest in DNS security and malware-blocking DNS providers, and inspired by Windows 10's DoH auto-template recognition feature, this project grew from personal research into a comprehensive, verified registry configuration ready for public sharing‚Äîand hopefully, another successful Microsoft collaboration.
