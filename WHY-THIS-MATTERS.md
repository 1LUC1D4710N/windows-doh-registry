# Why This Project Matters - An Open Invitation to Microsoft

## 📊 The Current Situation

**Windows DoH Support Timeline:**
- **May 2020:** Microsoft introduced DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Windows 10 build 19628
- **August 2020:** Added DoH controls to Settings UI
- **October 2025:** Still only **3 DNS providers** in the default list

**Microsoft's Official Default List (unchanged since May 2020):**
1. **Cloudflare** (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) → https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
2. **Google Public DNS** (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) → https://dns.google/dns-query
3. **Quad9** (9.9.9.9) → https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query

**Microsoft's Official Documentation:**
- Initial Announcement (May 2020): https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/windows-insiders-can-now-test-dns-over-https/ba-p/1381282
- Technical Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support

**That's it. Only these 3 providers. No updates in 5+ years.**

---

## 🌍 What Windows Users Are Missing

While Microsoft's list has remained static, the DNS privacy landscape has evolved significantly:

### New Privacy-Focused Providers (NOT in Microsoft's List)
- **Control D** (76.76.x.x) - Launched 2021, highly customizable DNS with 6 filtering profiles
- **DNS4EU/JoinDNS4** (86.54.11.x) - Launched 2023, European Union-funded public DNS infrastructure

### Enhanced Service Variants
- **Family-safe filtering** - Multiple providers now offer child protection
- **Ad-blocking variants** - DNS-level ad and tracker blocking
- **Regional options** - European data sovereignty compliance
- **Customizable profiles** - User-controlled filtering levels

### Missing Coverage
- ❌ No European data sovereignty options
- ❌ No family-safe variants in default list
- ❌ No ad-blocking DNS options
- ❌ No customizable filtering profiles
- ❌ Only basic, unfiltered DNS available by default

## 🤝 An Open Invitation to Microsoft

### Dear Microsoft Windows Team,

This project was built out of passion for DNS security and a desire to help Windows users protect their privacy. After discovering Windows 10's DoH auto-template feature in 2020, I spent years researching, verifying, and documenting DNS providers that support DoH.

### 👤 You Know Me - We've Worked Together Before

I'm the Greenlander IT enthusiast who spent years providing feedback about **File Explorer tabs**. Remember all those requests for browser-style tabs in File Explorer? That was me (and many others, but I was persistent!). 

**Microsoft listened, and File Explorer now has tabs.** 🎉

That experience taught me that **Microsoft does listen to community feedback** when it's:
- Well-researched and documented
- Based on real user needs
- Presented professionally
- Backed by verification

**Now I'm back with 5 years of DoH research, hoping for the same collaboration.** 🇬🇱➡️🪟

**I'm publishing this openly because:**

1. **Users need more options** - The current list of 3 providers hasn't changed since 2020
2. **Privacy landscape has evolved** - New providers offer better privacy and European compliance
3. **Community collaboration works** - Open sharing leads to better solutions
4. **You might find this useful** - Years of verification work, ready to use

### What I'm Offering:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎁 WHAT MICROSOFT GETS                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✅ 125 verified DNS configurations                         │
│  ✅ 12 DNS providers (you have 3, I've verified 9 more)     │
│  ✅ Complete verification notes with source citations       │
│  ✅ European provider options for GDPR compliance           │
│  ✅ Family-safe variants with parental controls             │
│  ✅ Comprehensive documentation ready for integration       │
│  ✅ Years of research - verification work already done      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How This Could Help Windows Users:

**Option 1: Official Integration**
- Expand Windows' default DohWellKnownServers list
- Give users more privacy-focused options out-of-the-box
- Include European providers for data sovereignty
- Add family-safe variants for parental controls

**Option 2: Official Documentation**

- Guide users to verified third-party DNS options
- Provide instructions for manual DoH configuration
- Help IT administrators deploy privacy-focused DNS

**Option 3: Community Recognition**

## 💭 A Personal Note

I started this project as an IT support student, fascinated by how DNS could protect users from malware and surveillance. Over the years, I've:

- Watched DNS privacy tools evolve
- Verified every entry against official sources
- Documented comprehensive provider information
- Learned the importance of encrypted DNS

**I'm publishing this because I believe:**
- Privacy should be easy, not complicated
- Community research has value
- Windows users deserve more options
- Maybe together, we can make this better

### To Microsoft:

If you're reading this, thank you for introducing DoH to Windows. It was a great start in 2020. This project isn't criticism—it's an offer to collaborate.

**We've worked together successfully before** (File Explorer tabs), and I know Microsoft listens to well-researched community feedback. This project represents years of verification work, and I'm sharing it openly—just like I shared my File Explorer tab feedback.

**You built the foundation. Let's expand it together.**

*From a silly Greenlander who loves Windows and wants to help make it better*  
*Former IT-Supporter → Current IT-Technologist Student → Persistent Windows Feedback Provider* 🇬🇱➡️🪟

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**5 years.** That's how long Microsoft's DoH list has gone without updates.

**5 years** of new privacy-focused DNS providers emerging.  
**5 years** of users manually configuring DoH.  
**5 years** of European providers offering better privacy.  
**5 years** of community wanting more options.

**This project fills that gap.**

Whether Microsoft officially integrates this, references it, or simply takes inspiration from it—**Windows users win.**

And that's what matters.
